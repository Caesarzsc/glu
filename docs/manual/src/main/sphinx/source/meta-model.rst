Meta Model
==========
The glu :ref:`meta model` is a file (or set of files) which describes where the various components of glu will be installed and how they will be configured.

.. note::
   The glu meta model should not be mistaken with the :doc:`static model <static-model>` which represents where the various components that glu manages will be installed and how they will be configured. This is why it is called the meta model: it is about glu itself, not what glu handles.
